# QuantumAssets: Secure and Scalable Digital Asset Management in Go

QuantumAssets is a robust, performant, and secure digital asset management system built entirely in Go. It provides a comprehensive solution for storing, managing, and distributing digital assets of various types, from images and videos to documents and configuration files. Leveraging advanced cryptographic principles and a distributed architecture, QuantumAssets ensures data integrity, confidentiality, and high availability.

This project aims to address the growing need for secure and scalable digital asset management solutions, particularly in contexts where data privacy and regulatory compliance are paramount. Unlike traditional asset management systems, QuantumAssets prioritizes security at every layer, employing techniques such as content-addressable storage with cryptographic hashing, role-based access control with fine-grained permissions, and audit logging for comprehensive accountability. The Go programming language offers inherent benefits in terms of performance, concurrency, and cross-platform compatibility, making QuantumAssets a compelling choice for organizations of all sizes.

The core functionality of QuantumAssets revolves around efficient storage, retrieval, and management of digital assets. It features a flexible metadata system that allows users to tag assets with custom attributes, facilitating search and organization. The system is designed to be easily integrated into existing applications and workflows through a well-defined API. QuantumAssets also incorporates a distributed storage architecture, allowing for horizontal scaling to accommodate growing data volumes and increasing user demand. By using QuantumAssets, organizations can streamline their digital asset management processes, reduce storage costs, and enhance data security.

## Key Features

*   **Content-Addressable Storage (CAS):** Assets are stored using their cryptographic hash (SHA-256) as their address, ensuring immutability and eliminating data duplication. This feature uses the `crypto/sha256` package in Go for hash generation.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Fine-grained access control based on user roles and permissions. Implemented using a custom permissioning system that evaluates access policies defined in YAML format. Uses the `gopkg.in/yaml.v2` library for parsing policy files.
*   **Distributed Storage Architecture:** Supports multiple storage backends, including local file systems, cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage), and distributed file systems (e.g., Ceph).  Utilizes Go's `io.Reader` and `io.Writer` interfaces for abstracting storage interactions.
*   **Metadata Management:** Assets can be tagged with custom metadata attributes, facilitating efficient search and organization. Uses a JSON-based metadata schema, validated with `encoding/json` package and custom validation functions.
*   **API-Driven Architecture:** Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for programmatic access to all features. Implemented using the `net/http` package and a routing library such as `github.com/gorilla/mux`. Includes API documentation generated with `swaggo/swag`.
*   **Audit Logging:** Tracks all asset operations (creation, modification, deletion, access) for auditing and compliance purposes. Uses the `log` package and a custom logging format for detailed event tracking. Logs can be rotated and archived according to configurable policies.
*   **Event-Driven Notifications:** Publishes events for asset changes, allowing integration with other systems and workflows. Implemented using a message queue such as RabbitMQ or Kafka, using libraries like `github.com/streadway/amqp` or `github.com/Shopify/sarama`.

## Technology Stack

*   **Go Programming Language:** The core language for building the entire application, leveraging its performance, concurrency, and cross-platform capabilities.
*   **net/http:** Used for building the RESTful API endpoints and handling HTTP requests and responses.
*   **crypto/sha256:** Implements the SHA-256 hashing algorithm for content-addressable storage, ensuring data integrity.
*   **gopkg.in/yaml.v2:** Used for parsing YAML configuration files, including access control policies and application settings.
*   **encoding/json:** Used for encoding and decoding JSON data for metadata management and API interactions.
*   **github.com/gorilla/mux:** A powerful routing library for handling HTTP requests and defining API endpoints.
*   **Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL):** Used for storing metadata, access control policies, and audit logs.  Interacted with using the `database/sql` package and a database driver such as `github.com/lib/pq` (PostgreSQL) or `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql` (MySQL).
*   **Object Storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage):** Used for storing the actual asset data, allowing for scalability and cost-effectiveness. Accessed using the respective cloud provider's Go SDK.

## Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Go 1.18 or later installed and configured correctly.
    *   A database server (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) installed and running.
    *   (Optional) An object storage service (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) configured.

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    

4.  **Configure the application:**
    Copy the `config.example.yaml` file to `config.yaml` and modify it to match your environment.  This includes database connection details, storage backend settings, and API port.
    

5.  **Create the database schema:**
    Run the provided database migration scripts (located in the `db/migrations` directory) to create the necessary tables.  This assumes you have a database migration tool like `golang-migrate/migrate` installed.
    

6.  **Build the application:**
    

## Configuration

The application is configured using a YAML configuration file ( `config.yaml`). The following environment variables are supported, overriding the values in the configuration file:

*   `QA_DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string.
*   `QA_STORAGE_BACKEND`: Storage backend type (e.g., `local`, `s3`, `gcs`).
*   `QA_API_PORT`: API port number.
*   `QA_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: AWS Access Key ID (if using S3).
*   `QA_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS Secret Access Key (if using S3).
*   `QA_AWS_REGION`: AWS Region (if using S3).
*   `QA_S3_BUCKET_NAME`: S3 Bucket Name (if using S3).

Example `config.yaml`:



## Usage

After installation and configuration, you can start the application by running the executable:



This will start the API server on the configured port.  The API documentation (generated using `swaggo/swag`) will be available at `/swagger/index.html`.

**Example API Endpoints:**

*   `POST /assets`: Upload a new asset.
*   `GET /assets/{id}`: Retrieve an asset by its ID (hash).
*   `PUT /assets/{id}`: Update an asset's metadata.
*   `DELETE /assets/{id}`: Delete an asset.

(Detailed API documentation, auto-generated by `swaggo/swag` should be consulted for a complete list of endpoints, request parameters, and response formats.)
